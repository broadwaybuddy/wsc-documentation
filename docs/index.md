## Background

### Wii Shop Channel

The [Wii Shop Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Shop_Channel) was an online store operated by Nintendo. For 13 years, owners of the Wii console could utilize the Wii Shop Channel to purchase and download Wii software from Nintendo.

Thanks to YouTube user "Steamy Jimmy", you can see some footage of the Wii Shop Channel in operation here:

### Closure of the Wii Shop Channel

In January of 2019, Nintendo [essentially discontinued](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/27560/~/wii-shop-channel-discontinuation) the Wii Shop Channel service. As of April 2021, the service remains accessible, but few portions of it remain.

Thanks to YouTube user "Nil Tavarez", you can see what the Wii Shop Channel looks like after the closure:

</div><br>

This remaining functionality, however, will eventually disappear. As Nintendo put it in [their discontinuation notice](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/27560/~/wii-shop-channel-discontinuation#s1q1):

>In the future, we will be closing all services related to the Wii Shop Channel, including redownloading purchased WiiWare, Virtual Console titles, and Wii Channels, as well as Wii System Transfer Tool, which transfers data from the Wii console to the Wii U console.

### Existing Alternatives

Without the Wii Shop Channel, most of the software that it hosted [is now legally impossible to obtain](https://www.vice.com/en/article/wjm5kw/nintendo-makes-it-clear-that-piracy-is-the-only-way-to-preserve-video-game-history). While this lack of access to hundreds of titles is ridiculous, piracy is not an acceptable solution, and it is not our right or responsibility to break the law.

Licensed Wii software, thankfully, is not the Wii's only software library. There is [a vast array](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/List_of_homebrew_applications) of [homebrew Wii software](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/WiiBrew:FAQ) that has been created by the homebrew community. Further still, homebrew Wii software is free and legal to distribute.

Currently, the primary method of downloading homebrew software is through the use of the [Homebrew Browser](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Homebrew_Browser), or its successor platform, the [Open Shop Channel](https://oscwii.org/).

### Case for development

The Homebrew Browser, and especially its successor, the Open Shop Channel, are excellent pieces of software. The Wii Shop Channel, however, holds a weighty amount of nostalgia, and currently lies defunct on every existing Wii.

Given the demand for homebrew software, the success of existing homebrew browsers, and the online sentiment surrounding the now-defunct Wii Shop Channel, there is a significant case for modifying the Wii Shop Channel software to act as a homebrew browser.
